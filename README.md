Bearing fault diagnosis using empirical modal decomposition and deep learning
  Abstract
  In the industry, to avoid monetary losses, it is important to know the state
  of the bearings of the machines since they represent 40 % of the total of the

  breakdowns. One way to know if the bearings have failures is through mat-
  hematical models that analyze the vibrations of the machine in operation.

  These models are composed of two stages, the first consists of extracting cha-
  racteristics from the vibration and the second consists of using a classifier

  to identify the fault. This research proposes a fault diagnosis that extracts

  characteristics through empirical modal decomposition and classifies the fai-
  lure thanks to deep learning. The model was tested with data from CWRU

  seeking to diagnose 10 types of bearing failures under varying operating
  conditions. The results obtained show that the model achieves an average
  accuracy of 97.23 %, where its strength is evident in the failures in early
  stages. Finally, the results show that the model is an excellent technique to
  carry out the predictive maintenance of bearings in industrial machineries.
